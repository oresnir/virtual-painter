# virtual-painter

This project implements a Virtual Painter. It's a software that allows you to draw in virtual space by recognizing hand movements.

The Virtual Painter can be used on existing images/videos or with a web camera. It is written in Python and based on MediaPipe, a library that enables recognition of the palm and extraction of relevant landmarks.

In order to use:
# pip install -r requirements

# python virtual_painter.py
